## notes

- [testmatch](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#testmatch-arraystring):The glob patterns Jest uses to detect test files. By default it looks for .js, .jsx, .ts and .tsx files inside
  of `__tests__` folders, as well as any files with a suffix of `.test` or `.spec` (e.g. Component.test.js or
  Component.spec.js). It will also find files called test.js or spec.js.
